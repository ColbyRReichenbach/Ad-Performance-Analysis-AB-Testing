# A/B Testing Ads Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on A/B testing for social media ad campaigns. The goal is to provide actionable insights into ad performance, campaign effectiveness, and strategic marketing optimizations.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes ad campaign data from a ficticious Company to identify key factors driving ad performance. It includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics, outlier detection, and performance metrics.
- **A/B Testing:** Campaign effectiveness and ad creative analysis with statistical validation.
- **Chi-Square Tests:** Evaluating demographic and interest-based segmentation.
- **Marketing Funnel Analysis:** Identifying bottlenecks in the customer journey.
- **Key Insights & Recommendations:** Data-driven strategies for growth.
